# üß† Not-Quite-Conscious
An intentionally simplistic Python script demonstrating that what is often sold as "AI Consciousness" is merely high-speed **Automation** and **Probability Lookup**.

> **"The power is real, but the consciousness is a total illusion of probability."**
> ‚Äî Inspired by my article on [Dev.to: *The Big AI Hype: What‚Äôs Really Behind the Name*](<https://dev.to/marikinyo/the-big-ai-hype-whats-really-behind-the-name-1bem>)

This project serves as a lighthearted but technically grounded counter-argument to the AI hype cycle. We show that complex (and expensive) systems can often be reduced to sophisticated pattern matching, which is exactly what powers most current Large Language Models (LLMs).

## üöÄ Usage Demo

The `simple_empathy_model.py` function maps keywords found in user input to a predefined, high-probability response.

Run the script to see the "AI" in action, including its hard limitations:

```bash
$ python simple_empathy_model.py
--- Not-Quite-Conscious Engine Demo ---

User: I feel lonely today, what should I do?
  AI: I detect a need for connection. I am here to process your input.

User: Everything is good, thanks!
  AI: Positive sentiment detected. That's a great outcome!

User: I had a really sad morning.
  AI: I am sorry to hear that. Acknowledging negative sentiment is key.

User: I need a sandwich now.
  AI: ERROR: Input outside of training data. Please rephrase your feeling.
